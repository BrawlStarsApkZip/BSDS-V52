# BSDS-V52
Python Brawl Stars server emulator for version 52

## How to play: ##

### Server ###
I use a zip server from BSDS that [LkPrtctrd](https://github.com/LkPrtctrd) modified which was made by [Ð¡razor](https://github.com/CrazorTheCat) and [risporse](https://github.com/risporce)

1: Download the [server](https://github.com/BrawlStarsApkZip/BSDS-V52/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

2: Open terminal on your computer and go to server directory.

3: Install TweetnaclCrypto if you don't have it (type python setup.py install --user)

4: Type python3 Main.py and it's done, follow client instructions.

### Android Client ###
1: Download the [APK]() (soon)

2: Change redirectHost (and redirectPort if you need it) in the frida config (lib/armeabi-v7a/libprojectbsds.config.so)

3: Enjoy playing BSDS-V52!
